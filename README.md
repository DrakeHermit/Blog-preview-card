## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to work with HTML and CSS more closely. Even though the blog card component wasn't all that difficult it still took me some time to figure out how to make it responsive, I also had some issues with the svg because I imported it with <img> tag instead of using <svg> tag. Overall it took me only few hours to finish this challenge but I feel like I learned quite a lot in the process.

### Continued development

I still need to get better in making everything responsive, I still struggle with that.
